# Milestone 2

The second milestone builds on Milestone 1 by including a single slot proof voting strategy, an L1 execution strategy, and finally an L1 interaction [1] contract that we call StarkNet Commit along with a corresponding auth contract for this type of interaction on L2. Additionally, we update the space contract to take an array of voting and auth strategies rather than just a single option for each.

### Changes to the space contract

We add one function (**finalize_proposal**), and modify the constructor to take a list of authenticators and voting strategies. Modify **propose** to take a **execution_params** as a parameter.

#### Functions

- **finalize_proposal(proposal_id: felt)**

Finalizes the proposal, counts the votes FOR and AGAINST, calls the **executor_contract** by providing **has_passed**, **executionHash** and **executions_params** as parameters. Callable by anyone.

### Single Slot Proof Voting Strategy Contract

We add the principal voting strategy of Snapshot X to this milestone. The single slot proof strategy will allow the balances of the majority [2] of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens to be used to find voting power. 

#### Functions

- **get_voting_power(address: EthAddress, ethereum_block_number: felt, params: felt array)**  
Returns the voting power for a specific address at a specific Ethereum block number **block_number**, **params** are the storage proof data required by the Fossil module to prove the contents of a slot. In the case of finding the voting power from an ERC20 balance, the slot will correspond to the storage slot in the ERC20 contract where the balance of **address** is stored. 

### StarkNet Commit Contract

This global contract will allow an alternate way to interact with Snapshot X: Via an L1 transaction. The core benefit of this feature is to allow one to interact with Snapshot X without a signature. This will give smart contract accounts such as multi-sig wallets the ability to participate. 

The contract will have a single storage variable: The address of the global L1 Auth contract on StarkNet. This will be an immutable variable set at construction of the contract.

#### Functions 

- **commit(hash: bytes32)** \
Sends the hash provided to the StarkNet messaging bridge with the L1 Auth contract as the destination address.

### L1 Auth Contract 

Auth contract for interactions with Snapshot X via L1. 

#### Functions 

- **commit_handler(hash: felt array)** \
L1 handler function that receives the hash sent by the Starknet Commit contract and stores it in its state.

- **execute(to : felt, function_selector : felt, calldata : felt array)** \
General purpose authentication for all types of interaction where the interaction parameters are sent and hashed to check that they match a hash recieved from L1. If so, the function given by **function_selector** at the **to** address is called with **calldata** as parameters. 

### Zodiac Execution Strategy Contract (L2)

Receives the message from the space contract. Decode the L1 contract address from the **execution_params**. Then forwards **has_passed**, **execution_hash** and **execution_params**, and the **caller_address** to the L1 contract address.

### Zodiac Module Contract (L1)

A way to execute Gnosis Safe transactions that are included in a proposal, once the vote has concluded successfully.
It holds an **l2_caller_whitelist** list of whitelisted l2 caller corresponding to the spaces deployed that could interact with the Zodiac Module Contract. This whitelist needs to be updated everytime a new space (that will interact with the Zodiac Module Contract) gets deployed on L2.

#### Functions

**receiveProposal(executionDetails: Uint256, hasPassed: Uint256, caller: Uint256, txHashes: bytes32[])** \
Consumes message from StarkNet bridge, checks proposal has passed, checks that **caller** is a member of the **l2_caller_whitelist**, and then hashes the **txHashes** array to check it is equal to **executionDetails**. If so, it stores the **txHashes** ready to be executed in a following transaction.

**executeProposalTxBatch(proposalIndex: Uint256, Raw Tx parameter arrays ...)** \
Hashes each transaction in turn and checks that it is equal to the corresponding txHash stored. If correct, executes that transaction. 

**updateWhitelist(add: Uint256[], remove: Uint256[])** \
Only callable by the **owner**. Updates the **l2_caller_whitelist** mapping by adding every element in **add** and removing every element in **remove**.

## Flows

The additional flows added to Milestone 2 are the processes of voting and proposing via an L1 transaction, along with executing a proposal via a Zodiac module.  

### Interact via L1 

The flows for all interactions via L1 start in the same way:

- 1: User submits a transaction to the Starknet Commit contract containing the hash of the parameters for the action one wants to take. 
- 2: The contract then submits a transaction to StarkNet over the messaging bridge with the destination address immutably set in the contract as the L1 Tx Authenticator, and the payload as the hash supplied.
- 3: The L1 Tx Authenticator receives the message and stores the payload parameters, it now waits for the strategy parameters to be submitted.

#### Propose via L1 
- 4a: User submits a StarkNet transaction to the **propose_via_L1** function of L1 Auth contract with the proposal parameters as arguments: The address of the space the user wants to create a proposal in **space**, the hash of the execution details **execution_hash**, the URI of the metadata **metadata_uri**, and the parameters required to get the voting power of the user **params** (This will most commonly be an encoded storage proof).
- 5a: The contract computes the hash of the parameters and checks that it matches a hash received via the bridge (in step 3). 
- 6a: The contract then submits an internal transaction to the **propose** function of the of the space contract specified by **space** with the **execution_hash**, the **metadata_uri**, and the **params** as arguments. 
- 7a: The proposal creation flow then continues just as specified in milestone 1 from point 4 onwards. 

#### Cast a vote via L1
- 4b: User submits a StarkNet transaction to the **vote_via_L1** function of L1 Auth contract with the vote parameters as arguments: The address of the space the user wants to create a proposal in **space**, the ID of the proposal **proposal_id**, the voter's choice **choice**, and the parameters required to get the voting power of the user **params** (This will most commonly be an encoded storage proof).
- 5b: The contract computes the hash of the parameters and checks that it matches a hash received via the bridge (in step 3). 
- 6b: The contract then submits an internal transaction to the **vote** function of the space contract specified by **space** with the **proposal_id**, the **choice**, and the **params** as arguments. 
- 7b: The vote submission flow then continues just as specified in milestone 1 from point 4 onwards.

### Execute Proposal with Zodiac Module 

- 8: Call **finalize_proposal** on the space contract by providing the **proposal_id** to execute.
- 9: On L1, call **receiveProposal** on the Zodiac Module Contract, providing the **executionHash**, **hasPassed**, **_txHashes**  and **execution_params** parameters.
- 10: On L1, call **executeProposalTxBatch** to execute the transactions!

#### Notes 

[1] We define interacting with Snapshot X to be the actions of: Creating a new proposal, and Voting. More may be added in future, such as updating space settings and delegation.  
[2] Certain implementations of ERC20 and ERC721 have non standard balanceOf implementations and will therefore need a custom strategy to work with Snapshot X.
